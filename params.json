My second favorite was math because I loved the logic and reasoning. **Created with Code, LLC** is the best combination of those two things. My goal is to support new developers and potential developers to see that programming is a very creative field, and it can be really fun when you learn how to communicate your logic in a way the computer understands. \r\n\r\nIn my experience, learning how to program is the most fun when you are writing games. The best part is when you can have a friend or family member play your creation. I want to help bring that experience to people.",
