<p>In school my favorite class was art because I loved the creativity of art projects. My second favorite was math because I loved the logic and reasoning. <strong>Created with Code, LLC</strong> is the best combination of those two things. My goal is to support new developers and potential developers to see that programming is a very creative field, and it can be really fun when you learn how to communicate your logic in a way the computer understands. </p>

<p>In my experience, learning how to program is the most fun when you are writing something useful or fun for someone else. The best part is when a friend or family member enjoys your creation. I want to help bring that experience to others.</p>
