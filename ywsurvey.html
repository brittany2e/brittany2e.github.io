		<h2>A note from Sister Daum</h2>
		<p>Brian Burns is returning this year to offer his professional expertise in Mental Health.  I know this was a class that was very well received last year and I am excited to have him back!</p>
		<p>He has asked me if I could get a quick survey out for him in preparation of his presentation this year.  The topic will be social media and how it affects our self esteem both good and bad.  It is five questions and should not take more than 3-5 min.  Even if a YW is not attending camp she may fill it out.  He would be very much appreciative!!!</p>
		<p>PLEASE STRESS THIS IS ANONYMOUS!!</p>
